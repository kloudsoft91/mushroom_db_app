    "description": "A. phalloides is one of the most poisonous of all known mushrooms. It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an \
    adult human. It has been involved in the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisonin. Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg covered by \
    a universal veil, which then breaks, leaving the volva as a remnant.",
    "lookalikes": "A. phalloides is similar to the edible paddy straw mushroom (Volvariella volvacea)[38] and A. princeps, commonly known as 'white Caesar'.[39] Some may mistake \
    juvenile death caps for edible puffballs[40][41] or mature specimens for other edible Amanita species, such as A. lanei, so some authorities recommend avoiding the collecting \
    of Amanita species for the table altogether.[42] The white form of A. phalloides may be mistaken for edible species of Agaricus, especially the young fruitbodies whose \
    unexpanded caps conceal the telltale white gills; all mature species of Agaricus have dark-colored gills.",
