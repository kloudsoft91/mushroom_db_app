    "description": "Macrolepiota clelandii, commonly known as the slender parasol or graceful parasol, is a species of mushroom-forming fungus in the family Agaricaceae. \
    The species is found in Australia and New Zealand, where it fruits singly or in small groups on the ground in eucalypt woodlands, parks, and roadsides. It is a tall mushroom \
    up to roughly 20 cm (8 in), with a broad cap covered with distinctive rings of dark brown scales. The whitish gills on the cap underside are closely spaced and free from \
    attachment to the slender stipe, which has a loose ring on its upper half, and a bulbous base. The edibility of the mushroom is not known with certainty, but closely related \
    parasol mushrooms are edible and some are very sought after.",
    "lookalikes": "M. procera is a larger with broad caps up to 12 in (30 cm) in diameter, and the stipe surface is covered with brownish zigzag bands or scaly girdles on a \
    whitish background. The 'false parasol', Chlorophyllum molybdites, a toxic species that can be mistaken for M. konradii, also occurs in Australia (but not New Zealand). \
    It can be distinguished by its green spore print and gills that turn light green in age. Some deadly poisonous Lepiota species have a similar pattern of scales on the cap, \
    but their fruitbodies are smaller",

    "description": "A. phalloides is one of the most poisonous of all known mushrooms. It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an \
    adult human. It has been involved in the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisonin. Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg covered by \
    a universal veil, which then breaks, leaving the volva as a remnant.",

    juvenile death caps for edible puffballs[40][41] or mature specimens for other edible Amanita species, such as A. lanei, so some authorities recommend avoiding the collecting \
    of Amanita species for the table altogether.[42] The white form of A. phalloides may be mistaken for edible species of Agaricus, especially the young fruitbodies whose \
    unexpanded caps conceal the telltale white gills; all mature species of Agaricus have dark-colored gills.",
